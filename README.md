## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Next.js
**APIs used:** None

- First website using Next.js. All components were styled mostly with Material-UI.

## Optimizations

Could of use the Next.js Image Component instead of the standard html img tag. The Next.js Image component can help with minification of the file size thus improving the performance of the image depending on device the user is using and the data speed of their provider. Intergrate Glovo and Just Eat API to make ordering within the site. The data that is rendering the menu can be retrieved from a third party database provider such as Airtable, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL: but in this case for this simple app Airtable will be likely. This use of third party apis requires a serverless function to be called.
